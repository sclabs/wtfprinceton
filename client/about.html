  <h1>wtfprinceton</h1>
  <p>A place to vent feelings, identify issues, and propose solutions.</p>
  <p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.wtfcolumbia.com">www.wtfcolumbia.com</a>.</p>
  <p>wtfprinceton is still currently in early alpha, and as such, bugs are to be expected. Please bear with us and report issues <a href="http://github.com/sclabs/wtfprinceton/issues">here</a>.</p>
  <h2>Common Issues</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must sign in with a princeton.edu Gmail account. We are looking to improve this in the future to allow non-Gmail accounts to use the site. If you accidentally sign in with a non-princeton.edu Gmail account, try to sign out, sign in to any Google service with your princeton.edu Gmail account, and then sign in to wtfprinceton again.</li>
    <li>The site does not work on mobile browsers at all at this time, and the user interface may be inconsistent at different window sizes.</li>
  </ul>
